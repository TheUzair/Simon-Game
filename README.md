# Simon-Game
Simon Game is a classic memory game where the player must repeat a sequence of colored buttons that are lit up and played with a sound. The sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex as the game progresses. The player loses if they miss a step in the sequence.  This game is responsive made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have fun!!!
